# Open-Vehicle-Android (OVMS Android App)

## Introduction

This is the Android App for the Open Vehicles Monitoring System (OVMS).


## Install

Main releases are available from [the Google Play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.openvehicles.OVMS)
and are archived here in the "[release](https://github.com/openvehicles/Open-Vehicle-Android/tree/master/release)" directory.

Latest builds are available here in the "[latest](https://github.com/openvehicles/Open-Vehicle-Android/tree/master/latest)"
directory. These are signed with the official OVMS App key, so can be installed over the Play store release
and vice versa without losing any configuration (except for bugs of course).

## Development and Contributions

**New developers are very welcome on any part of the system, and we will gladly provide any help needed to
get started.**

The purpose of this project is to get the community of vehicle hackers and enthusiasts to be able to expand 
the project. We can't do it all, and there is so much to do. What we are doing is providing an affordable and 
flexible base that the community can work on and extend.

Everything is open, and APIs are public. Other car modules can talk to the server, and other Apps can show the 
status and control the car. This is a foundation that others hopefully will interface to and and build upon.

**If you'd like to contribute, please accept our code of conduct:**

- Introduce yourself on the developer mailing list
- Be kind & polite
- Understand the framework concepts
- Ask if you need help
- Present your plans if in doubt
- Write decent code
- If you extend modules, stick to their code style
- Write brief but descriptive commit comments
- Add user level descriptions to the change history
- Provide documentation in the user guide
- Use pull requests to submit your code for inclusion

**A note on pull requests:**

Pull requests shall focus on one specific issue / feature / vehicle at a time and shall only mix 
vehicle specific changes with framework changes if they depend on each other. If changes are not 
or only loosely related, split them into multiple PRs (just as you would do with commits).

Usage hint: create a branch for each pull request, include only those commits in that branch (by 
cherry-picking if necessary) that shall be included in the pull request. That way you can push 
further commits to that branch, Github will automatically add them to an open pull request.


## Donations

The OVMS is a non-profit community project. Hardware production and service can normally be financed by sales, 
but some things (e.g. prototype development and certifications) need extra money. To help the project, you can 
make a donation on the OVMS website: https://www.openvehicles.com/forum

Please also consider supporting the vehicle developers directly. Check out their web sites and support
addresses for their respective donation channels.

**Thank you!**
